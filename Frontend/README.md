# Introduction

This front app is using ReactJs with server-side rendering(SSR) and Shopify Polaris UI framework. SSR can solve cross-origin HTTP request problem. Also, SSR is good for later improvements, such as add cache for requests. I also used redux to store all the data. Since we are not editing any of work or worker, redux is kind of useless for now. But once we start adding more functions to the app, redux will become useful.

### `yarn`

To get node packages

### `yarn start`

Runs the frontend app in the development mode.

The server will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any errors in the console.

# Why I am taking too long

I spend too long on trying to make my own Webpack configs and I failed. So I used an SSR template from git hub.
